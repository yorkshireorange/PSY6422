## Covidâˆ’19 Regional Immunisation in the Czech Republic

### Code book

This code book provides information about data sets used in the PSY6422 project.

-   Project presentation: <https://yorkshireorange.github.io/PSY6422/>

-   Project repo: <https://github.com/yorkshireorange/PSY6422>

*Please not that where variables were dropped and not used further, their Czech name is referenced. Variables that have been manipulated (and therefore translated) are labelled in English.*

### 1) Immunisation data

-   The data set is in the long format (i.e., several rows per observation to display to display unique combinations of all recorded variables).

#### **Used variables**

-   `region_name`: The official names of the administrative regions in Czech (see **Notes**).

    -   Uncategorised entries were dropped.

-   `region_id`: The statistical codes of the administrative regions within the European NUTS hierarchy (see **Notes**).

    -   Uncategorised entries were dropped.

-   `finished_vax`: The number of individuals who completed their Covid-19 immunisation.

#### **Unused variables**

-   `id`: A pre-assigned ID, possibly for internal identification purposes.

-   `date`: The date when individual observations were reported.

-   `orp_bydliste_nazev`: The official names of the administrative districts in Czech (see **Notes**).

    -   Contains both labelled and unlabelled uncategorised data.

-   `orp_bydliste_kod`: The statistical codes of the administrative districts within the Statistical Meta-information System (see **Notes**).

-   Contains unlabelled uncategorised data.

-   `vekova_kategorie`: The age group immunisation recipients fall within.

-   `ockovaci_latka_nazev`: The name of the European Medicines Agency-approved vaccine that was administered.

-   `ockovaci_latka_kod`: A code assigned to the approved vaccines, possibly for internal use of the Ministry.

-   `prvni_davka`: The number of individuals falling within observed categories who received the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.

-   `druha_davka`: A number of individuals falling within observed categories who received the second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.

-   `posilujici_davka`: A number of individuals falling within observed categories who received the booster dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.

### 2) Population data

-   The data set is not in a machine readable format. It is separated into several groups for which the data are provided: the Czech Republic, Administrative regions (used in the visualisation), Administrative districts.

#### **Used variables**

-   `pop_total`: The number of permanent residents per region

-   `region_id`: The statistical codes of the administrative regions within the European NUTS hierarchy (see **Notes**).

#### **Unused variables**

-   `Population - Males`: The number of male residents per category.

-   `Population - Females`: The number of female residents per category.

-   `Average age - Total`: Total average age per category.

-   `Average age - Males`: Average male age per category.

-   `Average age - Females`: Average female age per category.

### 3) Computed variables

-   `vax_per_pop`: The proportion of individuals with completed Covid-19 immunisation per total region population; computed by dividing `finished_vax` (Immunisation data) by `pop_total` (Population data).

### Notes

1.  *Administrative districts of municipalities with extended competence:* the smallest administrative districts in the Czech Republic, centered around 205 municipalities with extended competence [1].

2.  *Administrative regions:* A total of 14 self-governing areas of the Czech republic, roughly equivalent to UK counties or groups of unitary authorities [2].

3.  *NUTS:* Eurostat's Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics used for comparison of devolved administration units across the EU as well as funding purposes [3].
